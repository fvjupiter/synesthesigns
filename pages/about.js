          My name is Frederik Schoof, I&apos;m born in Hamburg in August 1997 and currently based in Bremen.<br/><br/>
          In early 2019 I decided to quit my cultural science &amp; philosophy studies @Universit√§t Bremen to work
          as a software developer for the web.<br/>
          Since then I started with plain <A domain='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>HTML</A>, <A domain='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS'>CSS</A>, <A domain='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript'>JS</A> in the first year and build some click-games which you can find under projects.
          I continued by understanding and using Frameworks such as <A domain='https://reactjs.org/'>React.js</A>, <A domain='https://nextjs.org/'>Next.js</A>, than added <A domain='https://tailwindcss.com/'>Tailwind.css</A> for faster styling
          as well as <A domain='https://www.contentful.com/'>Contentful</A>, <A domain='https://strapi.io/'>Strapi</A> and <A domain='https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore'>Firestore</A> for backend purposes to my skillset.<br/><br/>
          The use of these modern, industry-leading technologies has a lot of advantages over creating traditional Websites:<br/>
          <ul className='py-4 px-6'>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Faster loading times</li>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Improved security</li>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Greater stability</li>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Way more flexible</li>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Lightweight (requires less code)</li>
              <li className='font-light list-disc'>Scalable</li>
          </ul>
          to mention some.<br/><br/>
          You may ask yourself why wouldn&apos;t you just use an Editor like Wordpress and there is a simple <A domain='https://withloveinternet.com/blog/what-should-you-choose-wordpress-vs.-react-frameworks'>answer</A> to this:<br/>
          Wordpress does takes the traditional, outdated way of creating Websites and therefore suffer in terms of speed and security.
          Another aspect is, that you&apos;re bound to the design-elements and plug-ins that the editor provides which are most of the time also pretty weight-heavy. Imagine you would like to have a shuffle-button to mix the order of your photos, 
          create a custom calculator or even a simple game.<br/><br/>
